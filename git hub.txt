github
===============
it is a clooud based system
1) used to store code
2) to share code
3) host small website
4) version control

gitlab, bitbucket: this are same as github


Git
===============
toll used to perform github operations

Remote repository: storage space in github

local repository: storage space in our system for github

local storage: normal storage in our system


github operations
========================
1) push: uploading code from local repo to remote repo
2) clone: downloading the entire code from remote repo to local repo
3) pull: downloading only the updated files/code

How the operations are performing
==================================

steps:
1) add code from local storage to staging area by (git add)
2) copy code from staging area to local repo by (git commit)
3) copy from local repo to remote repo by (git push) 

Requirements
==================
1) need an account
2) git must be installed

initial setup
====================
git config --global user.name "GIT USERNAME"
git config --global user.email " EMAIL ID"

commands for pushing the code initially
===========================================
// to initialize particular folder as git repository
1) git init 

//add origin
2)git remote add origin github_repo_url

// to list the files that need to be pushed (red in color)
3) git status

// to copy files from local storage to staginng area
4) git add . 

// to copy file from staging area to local repository
5) git commit -m "message"

// to copy files from local repository to remote repository
6) git push origin master

from second time onwards
===========================

step 3 to step 6

to download full code
========================
git clone github_repo_url


to download only changes
==============================
git pull origin master
